# Revenue-Breakdown-by-week
This query provides a breakdown of weekly revenues and allows for further expansion to include revenue calculations for other months.

Explanation:

Step 1: This step defines a common table expression (CTE) named Weekly_Revenues to calculate the weekly revenues. It sums the client_total_cost from the booking_booking table while also determining the week of the year using MOD and date_part functions. It filters the results based on specific conditions.

Step 2: This step calculates the revenue breakdown by month. It retrieves the total weekly revenue for each specified month using subqueries within the SELECT statement. In this example, it calculates the revenue for January (weeks 1-5), February (weeks 6-9), and March (weeks 10-13). You can add similar calculations for other months as needed.
